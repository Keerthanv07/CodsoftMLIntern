Machine Learning Projects - README
This repository contains my projects completed during my internship at CodSoft, 
where I worked on various machine learning tasks, including classification and prediction across different domains. 
Below is a summary of the tasks, the models I implemented, and the learning outcomes.

Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms, model evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning
matplotlib, seaborn for data visualization

Setup Instructions:
Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/Keerthanv07/CodsoftMLIntern.git

Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the datasets (if applicable) from the respective sources and place them in the appropriate directories.

Run the individual scripts for each task:
Task-01: Movie Genre Classification
Task-02: Credit Card Fraud Detection
Task-03: Customer Churn Prediction
Task-04: Spam SMS Detection
